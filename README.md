# Light up the darkness
A framework for creating change locally, that creates ripples

## ================================================
## Framework work in progress, but it’s a good start as any
## ================================================
### Tenet
Expectations: I have none. This is something i want to do, because it feels right, to me. If it feels right, for you to contribute, in whatever form or shape you see fit, then do it.

### Why
The juice bar idea came naturally for me, as i was passing by a deserted house, in the middle of the village. I kinda just took it from there.

### How
- hire kids to teach them some responsibility and work skills
- buy vegetables/fruit from locals – give them means of making a little extra cash
- give decent prices healthy drinks for people w/ discounts for seniors
- use profits to sponsor stuff for kids like some educational trips
- create events where i tell kids stories about why we do what we do, how we see life etc, watching movies.

## ================================================

Improve furthermore as you see fit, either with other ideas, or add to this.
